                    <hr>
                  <h3>Contradiction of the Popular Vote</h3>

                  <p>According to the US National Archives, the Electoral College has contradicted the popular vote five times in American history, during the elections of 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016. This is because the distribution of votes in the Electoral College is unequal. Normally, each electorate should represent about 613,000 people (the population of the US divided by 538). But because of the fact that each state must have at least three electoral votes since all states have two senators and at least one congressional district, certain states are favored more than others (Jensen 8). For example, a Wyoming resident's vote would be worth about three times more than a Californian voter due to the population density (Jensen 8).  </p>
                
                  <h3>Winner Takes All</h3>
                  <p>Further driving this inequality in the presidential election process is the idea of "winner takes all" (Bolinger 180).  By having all states with the exception of “Maine and Nebraska" contain a policy that has the winner of each state take all the electoral votes, the minority vote can effectively be completely ignored, no matter how small the margin is (Jensen 8). Because of this, campaign strategies often ignore certain states as candidates are virtually guranteed to win those states. Instead, , efforts can then be focused on “swing states,” with “more resources allocated” to them, overrepresenting their desires against the other states (Panagopoulos 119). This can also create voter apathy. According to a study in the peer reviewed journal <i>Public Choice,</i> statistical analysis was used to imply that the Electoral College can cause "low voter participation rates" (Cebula and Murphy 185).</p>
                  <h3>Faithless Electors</h3>
                  <p>Even more scary is the idea of the "faithless elector," where the possibility of this ever occuring seems to undermine any semblance of democracy (Benett 121). Although the US counts the votes of the people, electors don't have to vote for the person they pledged to before (Benett 121). Instead, they can vote for whoever they want.  Historically, this has occurred in “1948, 1956, 1960, 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1988,” according to the House of Representatives Archives. Although “no president has ever come to office through the votes of faithless electors,” the very existence of this possibilty seems to mock democracy (Bennett 122). Attempts to prevent such an event from occuring have been made, however this has been met with limited success: “In the 1952 decision Ray v. Blair, the Supreme Court held that states may allow political parties to extract pledges of faithfulness,” but there was also the stipulation that such attempts are ‘legally unenforceable’ (Bennett 122).

                  <h3>What is the Electoral College?</h3>
      
                  <p>"It's a process, not a place" - US National Archives</p>
                  <p>The electoral college is the process in which the United States elects their president every four years. Instead of a popular vote, where the majority votes directly on who becomes president and vice president, there is instead a vote for 538 electorates, who then in turn vote for the president. </p>
                
                  <h3>Why 538?</h3>
                  <p>The number 538 is symbolic in that it takes after the numbers of the legislative branch. The Electoral College awards an elector to each congressional district/house representative and an elector per senator. Each state must have two senators and at least one congressional district, so each state will have at least three electoral votes. In total, there are 435 house seats and 100 senate seats. The 23rd amendment would bring Washington DC into elections by giving them three electoral votes, creating the current 538 number.</p>
                  <h3>History</h3>
                  <p>The Electoral College dates back all the way to the Constitutional Convention, over two centuries ago, and has its roots in political compromise (Bolinger 181). When the delegates at the convention stumbled upon the question on how the legislative branch would be arranged, there were arguments with regards to representation (Jensen 7). The states with more people wanted representation proportional to population, while the less dense states wanted the opposite for the same reason (Jensen 7). Eventually, a compromise was reached with a two house legislature (the House and Senate), and the Electoral College followed suit (Jensen 7).</p>
                  <p>Interestingly, democracy was not too much of a central concern for the Framers. Instead, they were more wary of the idea, scared that it would turn into mob rule. As Columbia University historian Eric Foner explains, the delegates "did not trust ordinary voters to choose the president and the vice president directly." For example, In a 1775 letter from Alexander Hamliton to John Jay, Hamilton refers to the general population by the words “unthinking populace.”  Similarly, George Washington called them the ‘grazing multitude’ (Wood 27). As Brown University historian Gordon S. Wood summarizes, “[c]ommon people, when they were noticed at all, were often looked upon as little better than animals” (235). </p>
                  <p>The Electoral College is undemocratic because it was not created with the goal of democracy.</p>

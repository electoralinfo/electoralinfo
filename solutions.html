                    <hr>
                  <h3>Viable Alternatives to the Election Process</h3>
      
                  <p>There are many ways to go about changing the Electoral College. There have been suggestions to “abolish the winner-take-all rule and allocate a state’s electoral votes among the candidates in proportion to each candidate’s share of the popular vote in that state” (Jensen 11). This would however, still run into the problem of representation, since the senate still skews things (Jensen 11). There have been calls as well for electoral votes based only upon congressional districts,  as “used in Maine and Nebraska” (Jensen 11). This can run into the issue of gerrymandering easily though, where “[t]he dominant political party inevitably draws the lines to maximize the number of seats its party wins” (Jensen 12). There is also the simple idea of the popular vote, where the candidate with the most votes wins. This would get rid of the problem of ignored states, unequal representation, and truly match the will of the people. There is the potential problem of there being a large number of candidates in the race, which could cause someone to win with much support (Jensen 10). However, this can easily be fixed by setting a minimum number of votes percentage-wise and having runoff elections (Jensen 10).

                  <h3>1960s Attempt and Current Opinion</h3>
                  <p>Within the 1960s there was an attempt in reforming the Electoral College, but this would fail in the Senate (Witte). However, support for reform is still mildly popular today. According to a Gallup poll, between 2002 and 2016, support for changing the Electoral College stayed at about 60% (Swift). While 2016 saw a drop in support for this, most still opposed the Electoral College, with 49% opposing and 47% supporting it. In 2020, another Gallup poll found that the support for the popular vote rose again, with 61% wanting change (Brenan).
                </p>
                <h3>Alternate Opinions</h3>
                <p>Some may argue that the end of the Electoral College would cause the problem of representation introduced centuries ago to rear its head today. They may be scared that suddenly, those who are in denser regions may overrule the more rural areas. While this fear is valid, the popular vote probably won't cause majority overrule. This is because a presidential candidate still has to consider those in less populous areas. Combined, those areas still have millions of voters. So, the candidate might be more willing to compromise with both groups to maximize their chances of winning. From a democratic standpoint, it also seems preferable to have the majority overrule in the US, rather than the minority. According to Thomas Pogge, a professor of philosophy as well as of political science at Yale, “Democracy means that political power is authorized and controlled by the people over whom it is exercised, and this in such a way as to give these persons roughly equal political influence” (Pogge 1). Within the definition of “roughly equal political influence,” it is clear that the popular vote, something that encompasses most of the adult population of the United States, would fulfill the idea much better than a group of 538 electors (Pogge 1). 
                </p>
                  <h3>How to Achieve Reform</h3>
                  <p>The hardest part about changing the Electoral College is that it needs an amendment. So, to change the Electoral College, it would need to first pass the House and the Senate with a two-thirds majority, and then get the approval of three-fourths of the state legislatures. Ideas like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact that try to find a loophole in needing an amendment are predicted by scholars to fail (Muller 129). Less enthusiastic voters in changing the presidential election process might argue that because of this difficulty (espeically within the current political climate), it would be better to place efforts towards more important issues in politics like healthcare and the economy. But, this forgets that the Electoral College determines who leads the Executive branch of the US. So, the Electoral College would have potentially adverse effects on any legislation, making it a priority issue. </p>
